FIRST OF ALL - intro -> menu -> play: choose your character -> "level 1:" map

colectibles could be just shiny dots which are special objects and at the end of each lvl if you've catched them it shows a picture (pixel art drawn by me siiiiigh) of the object and it's smth related to the story like misato's cross, the 3 computers, lance of longinus, shinji's music player... and it has a quote

--------------------------------------------------
map size=20*15? (1280*960)

paths:

level1/wall (or floor or enemy or whtv)
level2/wall
player/shinji (rei, asuka)

string changes first part, except for player where it changes 2nd part

enemies: 3 squares tall, only lowermost counts as hitbox

Levels: 

1 - sachiel - floor and walls dark blue, buildings with 4 red lights
2 - 
3 - enemies - ramiel
last one - third impact | enemies - final form rei - side scroller

secret lvl - second impact (OR shinji's trip, or both and the trip plays if your player is shinji (IN SHINJI'S TRIP THE ENEMIES ARE THE OTHER PLAYER SPRITES)

GAME ORDER:
-intro
-menu
-character sel screen
loop- cutscene (do this last (pixel art video with pixel text saying lvl x)) -> level -> collectible pic

--------------------------------------------------

1 folder per level - each folder contains the map data of the level
one addtional folder for player sprites - each lvl it picks the same on from the folder

second to last level the special object could be kaworu?

--------------------------------------------------

Additional features - worry later:

Music (and crickets)

Outro ("So long, and it all comes thumbling down")

pick controls on launch as args (define constants)

--------------------------------------------------
IMPROVE CODE:

-function to join several strings (takes path and number, automatically adds .xpm)

-function to display all frames in a video (correctly T_T)

-make first intro not static (might need to print a frame, then go back to main and keep track with static i)
